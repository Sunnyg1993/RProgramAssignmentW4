## The "run_analysis.R" should load the raw data and clean up following instructions, and get a tidy dataset

### Note that there is bug in the code for "name the activities in the data set", I use a for loop instead a mutate using a function. The problem in mutate is that it does not do vectorization but take the whole column as an input. 

## The "codebook.md" contains the code for variables in the tidy dataset
